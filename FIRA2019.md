1.  cv_camera_node:
    1.  Obtains a video stream from the camera
        1.  Using cv_camera package

            2.  https://answers.ros.org/question/288227/how-to-view-multiple-cameras-using-cv_camera/

        1.  roslaunch camera_tutorials camera.launch

2.  Visual perception:
    1.  Extracts a set of pixels defining the object we want to track and publishes the coordinates of this region of interest (ROI) on the topic /roi
        1.  range_detector_node:
            1.  Extract the color to track
            2.  rosrun camera_tutorials range_detector_node HSV (or RGB) /cam0/image_raw
            3.  TODO:
                1.  Copy the the value into new file, create python dictionaries (CANCELLED)
                2.  Copy the value, and paste (key-in) in color_tracking_node

        2.  color_tracking_node:
            1.  Single
                1.  track (by subscribe the range_detector_node published topic: /range_filter_[COLOR]) and publishes the coordinates of ball region of interest (ROI) on the topic /roi
                2.  TODO:
                    1.  change by read the value (python dictionaries) ---> track and, publish roi (CANCELLED)
                    2.  Update the value available from range_detector_node

            2.  Multiple (TODO)
                1.  track and publishes the multiple coordinates of ball region of interest (ROI) on the topic /roi (CANCELLED)
                2.  Use color_tracking_node (single) instead; but with multiple node (unique; based on color)
                3.  However, multiple_color_tracking_node can be used as a display purpose
